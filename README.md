# AnimeDataExploration_ChinguSoloProject

- AnimeData.ipynb shows the findings of sifting through an api that scrapes myAnimeList.
- i gathered data from the api and then used pandas to organize it and displayed the data in various formats using matplotlib and even created a regression model using sklearn
- for a more in-depth analysis read this medium article i wrote. https://medium.com/@amrmur/sifting-through-the-largest-anime-database-a-beginners-dive-into-data-analysis-visualization-27074683de60

- I used multiple list comprehensions, an external api, many libraries such as requests, json, pandas, matplotlib, time, sklearn, and wordcloud. 

- I also created an anime recommendation system using collaborative filtering and read a csv file on the anime_rec.ipynb.

- So I demonstrated at least 4 of the intermediate skills ( Intermediate Data Structures, Modules & Packages, Working with External Files, and APIs).

- I also demonstrated some advanced skills such Data manipulation and machine learning, so I'm sure this project is more than enough for the intermediate.
